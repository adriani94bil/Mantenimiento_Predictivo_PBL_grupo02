# Mantenimiento Predictivo PBL Grupo 02

This repository contains the source code for the Mantenimiento Predictivo PBL Grupo 02 project. The project aims to implement predictive maintenance techniques to improve the reliability and efficiency of industrial equipment.

## Folder Structure

The `src` folder contains all the source code for the project. Below is a brief description of each file and its purpose:

### `data_preprocessing.py`

This module is responsible for preprocessing the raw data collected from the equipment sensors. It includes functions for cleaning, normalizing, and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis.

### `feature_engineering.py`

This module contains functions for extracting meaningful features from the preprocessed data. These features are used as inputs for the predictive models.

### `model_training.py`

This module is responsible for training the predictive models. It includes functions for splitting the data into training and testing sets, selecting the appropriate machine learning algorithms, and evaluating the model performance.

### `predictive_maintenance.py`

This module contains the main logic for implementing predictive maintenance. It uses the trained models to predict equipment failures and schedule maintenance activities accordingly.

### `visualization.py`

This module provides functions for visualizing the data and the results of the predictive models. It includes plots for data distribution, feature importance, and model performance metrics.

### `utils.py`

This module contains utility functions that are used across different parts of the project. These functions include data loading, saving models, and other helper functions.
